# 🌾 HarvestLink - SMS-Based Harvest Guardian and Market Optimizer

**Empowering African smallholder farmers with AI-powered post-harvest loss prediction and market optimization through simple SMS messages.**

## 🎯 Problem Solved

- **40-60% income loss** from post-harvest losses and market inefficiencies
- **Limited connectivity** and literacy constraints in rural areas
- **Market access barriers** preventing fair pricing
- **Lack of predictive intelligence** for optimal harvest timing

## 🚀 Solution Overview

HarvestLink is a unified SMS platform that:
1. **Predicts post-harvest losses** using ML models trained on FAO data
2. **Clusters farmers** into dynamic selling groups for better bargaining power
3. **Matches groups with buyers** from a vetted database
4. **Forecasts optimal prices** and hold/sell timing
5. **Provides actionable advice** via simple SMS responses

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Flask Backend**: Python web service handling SMS processing
- **Twilio Integration**: Unified SMS input/output handling
- **ML Models**: 
  - Random Forest for loss prediction
  - K-means clustering for farmer grouping
  - Time-series regression for price forecasting
- **SQLite Database**: Farmer/buyer data and transaction history
- **Heroku Deployment**: Scalable cloud hosting

### ML Pipeline
```
SMS Input → Parse Data → Loss Prediction → Farmer Clustering → 
Price Forecasting → Buyer Matching → SMS Response
```

## 📱 How It Works

### For Farmers
1. **Send SMS**: `maize 50kg Nairobi traditional dry`
2. **Get Analysis**: Loss prediction + mitigation advice
3. **Receive Matches**: Buyer contacts + price forecasts
4. **Make Decisions**: Hold or sell based on AI recommendations

### Sample SMS Flow
```
Farmer: "maize 50kg Nairobi traditional dry"

HarvestLink: "🌾 HARVESTLINK ANALYSIS
📊 LOSS PREDICTION: MEDIUM risk
⚠️ Moderate risk. Consider: 1) Dry maize for 2 more days 2) Check for pests 3) Improve ventilation
💰 PRICE FORECAST: 220 KES/kg (7-day forecast)
🤝 BUYER MATCHES: 3 found
1. AgriCorp Kenya (Nairobi) - 200-250 KES/kg
2. Grain Traders Co (Kisumu) - 180-220 KES/kg
📈 RECOMMENDATION: Hold for better price
Reply with 'BUYERS' for contact details"
```
